# Deep-cut

## Description
We have implemented the paper ["DeepCut: Object Segmentation From Bounding Box Annotations Using Convolutional Neural Networks"](deepcut.pdf) by Rajchl et al.

## Usage

* To generate weakly annotated images (with bounding boxes), use `deepcut/annotating.py`.
* For inference or training on the weakly annotated images, use `deepcut/main.py`.
* To evaluate the segmentation wrt manual segmentation, use `deepcut/evaluate.py`.
